Below are some sample queries against the Courses table.

//Displays all columns in the Courses table.
SELECT *
FROM Courses 

//Displays the roster of students who are in the Algebra course.
SELECT
Name
FROM Courses
WHERE Course = 'Algebra'

//Displays the roster of students in alphabetical order by first name who are in the Statistics course.
SELECT
Name
FROM Courses
WHERE Course = 'Statistics'
ORDER BY Name

//Displays the average grade in the calculus course.  
SELECT
AVG(Grade) AS 'Average Grade'
FROM Courses
WHERE Course = 'Calculus'

//Displays the student and grade who received the highest score in the Algebra class.
SELECT
TOP 1
Name,
Grade
FROM Courses
WHERE Course = 'Algebra'
ORDER BY Grade DESC

Here are some exercises to try on your own.  

EXERCISES:

1.  Write a query to find out how many students are taking a trigonometry course.  

2.  Write a query to find out which students received a passing grade in the algebra course.  
    Assume that a passing grade is 70% or higher.  Display both the student names and their grades.  

3.  Write a query to find out who received the lowest grade in the calculus course.  Display the student name and their grade.

4.  Write a query to find out the average score in the statistics course.  Display the column as "Average Grade".  

5.  Write a query to find out who got an A in the calculus course.  Display student names and grades from highest to lowest.
