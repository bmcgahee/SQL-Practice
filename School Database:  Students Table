Check out these sample queries.  

//Selects all students and places the first and last name of
//each student in first column and grade level in second column.

SELECT
FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'Student Name',
Grade AS 'Grade Level'
FROM Students

//Similar query as before, but orders the students 
//by grade level in ascending order.

SELECT
FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'Student Name',
Grade AS 'Grade Level'
FROM Students
ORDER BY [Grade Level] ASC

//Selects all 10th grade students, showing their student ID number
//in first column and their student name in second column.

SELECT 
ID AS 'Student ID',

FROM Students
WHERE Grade = 10

//Selects students whose ID numbers are between 10 and 40,
//displaying their full name and grade level.
//Student records are ordered by their last name.  

SELECT 
FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'Student Name',
Grade
FROM Students
WHERE ID >= 10 AND ID <= 40
ORDER BY LastName

//Selects all columns from Students table,
//displaying the juniors and seniors in descending order.

SELECT *

WHERE Grade IN (11, 12)
ORDER BY Grade DESC 

//Selects the first name, last name, grade level of students
